<p align="center">Project Description</p>

This project has been developed with the objective to show that cost-sensitive learning 🔨💰 is important when training models on an imbalanced dataset. 

* A Logistic Regression classifier has been compared to itself by means of tuning hyperparameters, with emphasis being out on the "weights"- parameter.

* Model	performance (AUC) increases from 80% to 89% by means of definig "penalties" for false predictions of the minority class.
